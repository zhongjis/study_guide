## Lectures
### lecture 1 - teamwork
  - **moxon’s theory**
    - know what the four stages are and what happens in each
      - stage 1: forming: initial awareness (why are we here? will I be accepted)
        - introductions, socializing
        - team tries to come to a consensus on their purpose
        - generally, people are on their best behavior
        - cliques may form
        - a team leader may emerging
        - (recommendations)
          - discuss team expectations
            - establish ground rules
            - be as specific as possible 
            - hold each other (and yourself) accountable
          - define team roles and responsibilities
            - facilitator 
              - help team organize, focus, participate, be productive
            - recorder
              - maintains and distributes team record (actions, decisions)
            - participants (all)
              - generate ideas, complete tasks
      - stage 2: storming: sorting-out process (who has what kind of control and power? will I be respected)
        - the most painful, but most important stage
        - role negotiation is the undercurrent
        - competition/conflicts/battles/challenges
        - (recommendations)
          - communicate! make sure everyone stays in the loop
            - write things down
          - a goal to aim for: everyone is doing effective things, not destructive things
            - refer to the ground rules
          - there is no cookbook strategy for getting through this phase — its difficult, and each group is unique.
      - stage 3: norming: self-organization(how are we going to work together? how can i help this group)
        - members collaborate rather than complete 
        - creativity increases
        - leaders becomes facilitators
        - teammates have roles but role boundaries are fluid
        - teammates tolerate and accomandate other’s weaknesses
        - a team spirit is developed
        - (recommandations)
          - keep up the good practices from this and previous stages
      - stage 4: performing: maturity (how can we do better?)
        - the effective patterns of behavior are now the norm
        - the team achieves more than the sum of what its members could fo individually
        - the team has the ability to prevent or work through problems
          - teamwork skills to focus on and develope this quarter
            - provide and receive constructive feedback
            - use feedback received to improve your work without taking it personally

              - positive attitude
              - provide honest, accurate schedule estimates and dependably deliver on them
  - **effective interpersonal behavior / teamwork skills to focus on this quarter**
    - have experience with these you can share
      - active listening "what i hear you saying is ... "
      - check what you hear with others, not just the speaker
      - if you disagree, say no
      - no interrupting
      - if you don't understand, ask questions then
      - allow everyone to participate
      - honesty and self-disclosure
      - look for facts in complaints; always bring it back to a technical discussion
      - keep criticism constructive 
      - decide what to do with each criticism (don't leave it hanging)
      - accept / act on at least some of the feedback you are given
      - validate others' contributions
      - ask quiet ones what they think
      - politely cut off domineering ones 
      - find and follow systematic ways of working


### lecture 2 - intro to RE
  - **what is system?**
  - System
    - a collection of components organized to accomplish a specific function or set of functions
    - a model of a combination of components and interrelations between these components
  - **the inf 113 definition of a requirement**
    - a statement that: 
      - states system functionality (a capability)
      - can be validated
      - must be met or possessed by a system
      - achieves a customer objective
      - is qualified by measurable conditions and bounded by constraints
  - **types of requirements (process, functional, non-functional (execution, evolution, implementation)**
    - know how to categorize requirements
      - very general requirements
      - functional requirements
      - process requirements
      - non-functional requirements
        - execution 
        - evolution
        - implementation
  - **stakeholder: know the definition and be able to identify some given a problem description**
    - a stakeholder is a group or individual
      - affected by the system-to-be
      - may influence the way this system is shaped
      - has some responsibility in its acceptance
    - basic types of stakeholders
      - system engineers
      - system end-users
      - managers of system end-users
      - external regulators
      - domain experts
      - developers
      - ... many more
  - **the requirements engineering process: memorize the process**
    - domain understanding & requirements elicitation
    - evaluation / analysis & negotiation
    - specification & documentation
    - validation & quality assurance
    - go to the first on again
  - **importance of requirements:**
    - understand all the reasons why it is important to do requirements correctly (and what can happen if you don’t)
      - Brooks (1987): establishing stakeholder needs is the hardest single phase of system development
      - 55% of software faults can be traced to the requirements / design phases
      - half og the top software failure causes have to do with faulty requirements
    - cost reduction
    - improve customer satisfaction
    - safety
    - Obstacles to good RE Practice
      - RE efforts need to be spent before contract is signed
      - Pressure of tight schedules, short-term costs, leveraging technology
      - Lack of quantitative data on RE economics
      - Requirements documents viewed as cumbersome
  - **summary**
    - requirements define what the system should provide and define system constraints
    - requirements engineering is a varying and interdisciplinary process consisting of several activities - e.g. eliciting, analyzing, and documenting the system requirements
    - requirements problems lead to astronomical costs, low customer satisfaction, and unsage situations
    - doing RE correctly is crucial to the success of a project


### lecture 3 - requirement elicitation
  - **be able to explain the two parts of requirements elicitation (domain understanding and elicitation)**
    - (requirements engineering parallels)
      - you need to understand the application domain 
      - customers don't always know what they want
      - never make assumptions about what customers want
      - providing customers with even more than they ask for can sometimes be the wrong thing to do
      - customers can be troubles
    - (what is requirements elicitation)
      - the activities involved in discovering the requirements of the system
      - exploring the problem world identification of ...
        - improvement objectives
        - organizational / technical / environmental constraints / assumptions on system-to-be
        - stakeholder needs
        - alternative options for satisfying those needs
        - scenarios of hypothetical software-environment interaction 
    - Domain understanding
      - studying the system as-is
        - business organization, strengths / weaknesses, application domain
      - identifying the system stakeholders
    - Requirements elicitation
      - further analysis of problem with system-as-is
      - analysis of new opportunities 
      - identification of constraints on system-to-be, improvement objectives, usage scenarios, ...
    - Elicitation Goal: Understanding
      - Application domain understanding 
      - Problem understanding 
      - Business understanding 
      - understanding the needs and constraints of system stakeholders
  - **stakeholders - why/how are they difficult?**
    - (stakeholder analysis)
      - stakeholder cooperation is essential for sucessful RE
        - elicitation = cooperative learning
      - representative sample must be selected
      - stakeholder selection based on ...
      - relevant position in the organization
      - role in making decisions 
      - level of domain experise
      - exposure to perceived problems
      - personal objectives, potential conflicts
      - influence in system acceptance
    - stakeholders are difficult
      - difficult viewpoints
      - tacit knowledge, hidden needs
      - the most useful stakeholders are sometimes hard to access
      - dealing with change
      - => Needed: 
        - communication skills: talking to, listening from diverse people
        - trust relationship
        - knowledge reformulation & restructureing (review meetings)
        
  - **elicitation techniques: know what each is and why it is used**
    - **artifact-driven**
      - **background study**
        - collect, read, synthesize documents, gather data about... 
          - the organization 
          - the domain
          - the system-as-is
        - provides basics for getting prepared before meeting stakeholders
        - => prerequisite to other techniques
      - **surveys/questionnaires**
        - submit a list of questions + possible answers to selected stakeholders
          - multiple choice questions
          - weighting questions
        - effective method for collecting requirements when
          - collecting a small amount of data from a large number of people
          - people geographically distributed
          - time is limited
          - 100% coverage is not necessary
      - **storyboards/scenarios**
        - goal: acquire or validate info from concrete examples through narratives
        - illustrate typical sequences of interaction among system components to meet an implicit objective
        - widely used for
          - explanation of system-as-is
          - exploration of system-to-be + elicitation of further info
          - specification of acceptance test cases 
        - evolutionary, incremental, cooperative approach
      - **prototyping**
        - a prototype is an initial version of a system used for experimentation / feedback
          - focus on unclear, hard-to-formulate requirements
        - value: providing stakeholders with something concrete to evaluate
          - users can experiment with the system and point out strengths and weaknesses
        - quick implementation
      - **knowledge reuse**
        - goal: speed up elicitatino by reuse of knowledge from experience with related systems
    - **stakeholder-driven**
      - **interviews**
        - (be able to come up with some good elicitation interview questions given a problem description) 
        - primary technique for knowledge elicitation 
          1. select stakeholder specifically for info to be acquired (domain expert, manager, salesperson, end-user, consultant)
          2. organize meeting with interviewee, ask questions, record answers
          3. write report to interviewee for validation & refinement
        - single interview may involve multiple stakeholders
        - types of interviews
          - structured interview: predetermined set of questions
            - specific to purpose of interview
            - some open-ended, others with pre-determined answer set
            - => more focused discussion, no rambling among topics
          - unstructured interview: no predetermined set of questions
            - free discussion about system-as-is, perceived problems, proposed solutions 
            - => exploration of possibly overlooked issues
        - effective interviews should mix both method
        - interview pitfalls
          - subjectivity
          - inconsistencies
          - effectiveness of interview depends critically on quality of questions and interviewer's attitude.
      - **group sessions  aka focus groups**
        - more perception, judgemet, invention from interactions within groups of diverse people
        - elicitation takes place in series of group workshops (a few days each)
        - generally focused on high-level requirements
      - **ethography (observation and ethnographic studies)**
        - sometimes, the best way to understand what people do is to observe them at work
        - ethnographer spends time observing people at work and building up a picture of what and how work is done
        - focus on system-as-is


### lecture 4 - stakeholder analysis + SRS preview
  - **stakeholders - why/how are they difficult?**
    - stakeholders make requirements messy
      - personality, status, personal goals, technical expertise (or lack of it), background, political influence.
      - ideally, all stakeholders should be "CRACK"
        - collaborative
        - representative
        - accountable
        - committed
        - knowledgeable
      - stakeholders always conflict with each other
        - hierarchies, etc.
  - **be able to identify several stakeholders given a problem description**
    - **roles**
      - software development staff 
      - owners 
      - partners 
      - department heads, managers
      - regulatory bodies, legislative representatives
      - suppliers
      - customers (customers of your customer)
      - competitors
      - users
      - society (as a whole, or certain people groups)
      - environment

      - end users 
      - post-implementation support
  - **different types of stakeholder models**

    - developing stakeholder model and/or matrix
      - for each stakeholder, identify (simple stakeholder analysis template):
        - motivation
        - authority 
        - relation to other stakeholders
        - level of expertise
        - their expectations
        - your expectation of them
        - location/avaliability
        - priotity
      - these models serve as the basis for 
        - requirements elicitation
        - goal, domain, usage model
    - model 
      - textual
      - informal fiagram 
      - uml actor hierarchy
      - onion model
      - rich picture
    - **be able to create a rich picture given a problem description**
      - create a "graph" in which:
        - nodes are stakeholders
        - edges are relationships between stakeholders
        - primary concern(s) of each stakeholder is shown as a thought/speech bubble near the stakeholder
  - **roles of requirement specification**
    - (specification and document)
      - precise definition and documentation of all feature of the agreed upon system
        - objectives, concepts, relevant domain properties, system/software requirements, assumptions, responsibilities
        - Retionale for options taken, satisfaction arguments 
        - likely system evolution & variants
        - costs, workplan, delivery schedules (often in appendix)
      - organized in coherent structure and form understandable by all parties
      - resulting product = requirements document aka system / software something
    - (context of SRS document)
      - developed as joint effort between developer and customer
      - usually presented with system models developed during requirements analysis and further define part of the system to be developed
        - the SRS adds detail to requirements models but should be consistent with them.
      - a standard template is typically used to organize contents, such as
        - IEEE std 830-1998
          - recommended practice for SRS
    - (purpose / features of SRS document)
      - set out what the system should do (not how) and define constraints on its operation and development 
      - specify external system behavior
      - characterize acceptable responses to undesired events 
      - specify implementation constraints
      - address system lifecycle
      - be easy to change 
      - serve as reference tool for maintenance
    - (overview of SRS contents)
      - data requirements 
        - db
        - I/O formats 
        - system state
      - functional requirements 
      - non-functional requiremetns 
      - managerial requirements 
      - supporting information: to help the reader 
    - roles of requirements specifications 
      1. communication medium between groups of people working towards a common goal
      2. verification & validiation device
      3. contractual device
      4. managerial device for project planning and project management
      5. functional device for improving user's understanding of their real needs, may serve as early user manual
  - **SRS Attributes: know what each means and why its important**
    - correct: every requirement represents something required of the system to be built
    - unambiguous: every requriement has one and only one interpretation
    - complete: everything the software system is supposed to accomplish is included 
    - verifiable: there is a means to determine whether or not each requirement is satisfied
    - consistent: no requirements conflict 
    - modifiable: its structure and style are such that any necessary changes can be made easily
    - traceable: the origin of each requirement is clear and it facilitates referencing each requirement in future development
    - annotated: to provide guidance for developers, particularly w.r.t. relative necessity / priority / stability

    - (requirement measurability)

      | property    | measure                                                                                                            |
      | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
      | speed       | processed transactions / second or user / event response time or screen refresh time                               |
      | size        | k bytes or # of RAM chips                                                                                          |
      | ease of use | training time or number of help frames                                                                             |
      | reliability | mean time to failure or probability of unavaliability or rate of failure occurrence or avaliability                |
      | robustness  | time to restart after failure or percentage of events causing failure or probability of data corruption on failure |
      | portability | percentage of target dependent statements or # of target systems                                                   |

    - (SRS evolution)
      - requirements change
      - needed:
        - a formal change process
        - a changeable requirements document 
          - modular 
          - no redundancies

    - (summary)
      - stakeholders influence, are affected by, and have an interest in the system-to-be
        - identifying, classifying, and analyzing them is a central activity to requirement engineering
      - the SRS document sets out what the system should do (not how) and defines constraints on its operation and development
      - it is very difficult to formulate and manage a complete and consistent requirements specification
